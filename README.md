# service_app
A Consumer-Service Provider Connect App Where Customer can hire Service Provider Through a common Platform.
The main aim of this project is to create a system which connects consumers and service providers. The consumers and service providers can
both post their targeted requirements and seek out each other. The jobs may include short or long term services. Consumers
can browse for services and send requests to the service providers by filling the required details. The service provider who
finds the details of the service in accordance with his/her schedule and is ready to provide the service will accept the request
and will be assigned to the consumer.
